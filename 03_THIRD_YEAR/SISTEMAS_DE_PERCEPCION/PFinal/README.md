# ðŸŽ¯ Object Tracking by Color â€“ Final Project  
**Course:** Perception Systems (Sistemas de PercepciÃ³n)  
**Degree:** 3rd Year â€“ Computer Engineering (University of Huelva)

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This project consists of a color-based object tracking system developed in MATLAB. It captures video through a webcam and identifies an object based on its color using a manually designed RGB classifier. The system marks the centroid of the tracked object and visualizes it in real-time.


## ðŸ§  Main Features

- **Color segmentation** using handcrafted classifiers in RGB space.
- **Visualization** of color clusters and classifier boundaries.
- **Outlier removal** using interquartile filtering.
- **Object tracking** with centroid detection.
- **Enhanced tracking** by combining motion filtering with color classification.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- MATLAB
- Image acquisition and processing
- 3D plotting and RGB data visualization
- Manual tuning of RGB classifiers
- K-means clustering for color group analysis

## ðŸ“„ Documentation

You can find the full assignment brief in [`PRACTICA_Seguimiento_Color.pdf`](./PRACTICA_Seguimiento_Color.pdf), which outlines all the implementation phases and the expected tracking behavior.
