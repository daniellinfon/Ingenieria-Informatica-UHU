# üß† Programming Methodology

This folder contains two programming assignments completed for the **Programming Methodology** course, taken during the second year of the Computer Engineering degree. The assignments focus on modular programming, object-oriented design, and the use of both **C++** and **Java**.

## üìÇ Contents

### üìù Practice 1 (C++)

A modular application developed in C++ for managing **clients** and their **contracts** in a telecom company. The assignment is divided into two blocks:

- **Block 1.1:**
  - Implementation of `Cliente` and `Fecha` classes with proper encapsulation, date validation, operator overloading, and secure access to data.
  - Use of inheritance to create specialized contracts: `ContratoTP` and `ContratoMovil`, with dynamic memory and robust class design.

- **Block 1.2:**
  - Implementation of an `Empresa` class to store clients and contracts.
  - Use of polymorphism, `dynamic_cast`, and `typeid` to perform operations such as discounts, filtering, and counting contract types.

### ‚òï Practice 2 (Java)

This project focuses on building a **Java** application for managing clients and billing in a telecom context. Key goals include:

- Modular project structure using `libClases` and `libPruebas` packages.
- Inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, method overriding, `clone()`, `equals()`, and `toString()` implementations.
- Modeling different client types (`ClienteMovil` and `ClienteTarifaPlana`) with specific billing logic.
- The `Empresa` class acts as a central manager for all clients, allowing operations such as add, remove, update, clone, and total billing calculation.

These assignments demonstrate core object-oriented principles applied to real-world business scenarios.
