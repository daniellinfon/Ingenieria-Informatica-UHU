## 🏁 Practice 1: Cyclist Registration and Race Simulation

In this project, a system is developed to manage the registration and classification of participants in the "Huelva Extrema" mountain bike race. It involves:

- Managing two registration phases (international and local).
- Storing cyclist data in binary files.
- Designing a class `Prueba` to insert, modify, delete, and display participants grouped by country.
- Simulating a race by generating random performance times and ranking cyclists accordingly.
- Implementing a dynamic array (`Clasificacion`) to manage participants and sort them using bubble sort.

The project emphasizes **modular design**, **file I/O**, **object-oriented programming**, and **dynamic memory management**.

📄 See [`Enunciado_Practica1-2122.pdf`](./Practica1/PRACTICA_1/Enunciado_Practica1-2122.pdf) for full details.  
📄 [`examen_parcial_practicas_01_L6.pdf`](./Practica1\PRACTICA_1_ExL6/examen_parcial_practicas_01_L6.pdf) includes modifications for the midterm practical exam.

## 🔐 Practice 2: CriptoDoc – Text Encryption System

This assignment focuses on building a class `CriptoDoc` for encrypting and decrypting text files using a simple character-shifting algorithm.

Key features include:

- Reading and storing lines of text dynamically.
- Encrypting/decrypting using numeric codes (with wrapping in ASCII range).
- Concatenating documents.
- Reversing a list of codes using a custom stack.
- Decrypting multiple documents based on codes stored in an auxiliary file.

This practice explores **dynamic lists**, **modular programming**, **file handling**, and **basic cryptography logic**.

📄 See [`Practica2.pdf`](./Practica2/Practica2.pdf) for more details.

Feel free to explore the code, test the implementations, or use the logic as reference for similar data structure projects.
