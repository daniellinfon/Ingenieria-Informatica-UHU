# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Information System

This project consists of the design and development of a desktop-based Information System for managing a gym, built from a structured requirements analysis and a relational database schema.

The application follows a **client-server architecture**, implemented in **Java** using the **Swing** GUI toolkit. It supports connectivity to two types of database servers: **Oracle** and **MariaDB**, and is fully compatible with both. Communication with the databases is handled using the **Hibernate** ORM framework, which simplifies data access through object-relational mapping.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** – Core programming language
- **Swing** – GUI library for building the desktop interface
- **Hibernate** – Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for database interaction
- **Oracle** and **MariaDB** – Supported database management systems
- **NetBeans IDE** (recommended) – Development environment

The project showcases database-driven application design, modular development, and multi-database compatibility.
