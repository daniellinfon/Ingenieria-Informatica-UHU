# 🧠 Artificial Intelligence Systems  

This repository contains two practical projects focused on classic Artificial Intelligence techniques: constraint satisfaction and automated planning. Both were developed during the third year of the degree.

### 🔹 `Sudoku-solver` – Sudoku Resolution with AC-3 Algorithm  
This program solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using the **AC-3 (Arc Consistency 3)** algorithm, a well-known technique for **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)**.  

The file `2024_tableros.txt` is the input file. Each sudoku is a line of text.

### 🔹 `Task-planner` – Task Planning with STRIPS  
This project implements a simplified **STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver)**-style planner. Given an initial state, a set of possible actions with preconditions and effects, and a goal state, the planner finds a sequence of actions that leads from the start to the goal.

The file `plan.txt` is the input file. It contains states definition and possible actions.
