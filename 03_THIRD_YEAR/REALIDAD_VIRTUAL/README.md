## âš½ðŸš— Rocket League Training Game

The main objective of this project is to create a single-player game mode that serves as a training tool inspired by the original Rocket League. In this mode, the player controls a car with the objective of scoring goals by interacting with a ball inside a field bounded by walls.

The game has been developed using the **OpenGL** library, which enables 3D graphics rendering and realistic simulation of the physics involved in the interaction between the car, the ball, and other elements in the environment.

The file [MemoriaRV.pdf](./MemoriaRV.pdf) provides a detailed technical explanation of the project, including the structure of the 3D scene, object design, and testing methodology used to validate the gameâ€™s functionality.

ðŸ‘‰ **To play the game, simply run the executable file [`ProyectoRV.exe`](./ProyectoRV/x64/Release) included in the project directory.**
